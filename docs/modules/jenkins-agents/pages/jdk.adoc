= Jdk Jenkins agent

== Introduction
This agent is used to build Java code.

The image is built in the global `ods` project and is named `jenkins-agent-jdk`.
It can be referenced in a `Jenkinsfile` with `ods/jenkins-agent-jdk`.

== Features
. Nexus and HTTP proxy configuration for Maven & Gradle

== Supported Java Versions
This agent provides 3 JDKs: `java 11`, `java 17` (default) and `java 21`.

For backwards compatibility `java 11` is still included. Java projects migrating from previous ODS version will require the use of the bash script `use-j11.sh` to use java 11. A migration to `java 17` and `java 21` can be done afterwards.

To switch the environment to `java 11` the script `use-j11.sh` is provided at the jenkins home folder.
To switch the environment to `java 17` the script `use-j17.sh` is provided at the jenkins home folder.
To switch the environment to `java 21` the script `use-j21.sh` is provided at the jenkins home folder.
Following command shows how the jenkins build script from the springboot quickstarter switches the java version before calling the gradle wrapper:
```
def status = sh(script: "$HOME/use-j21.sh && ./gradlew clean build --stacktrace --no-daemon && $HOME/use-j17.sh", returnStatus: true)
```
NOTE: like this example, you will need to switch back to `java 17` after running the gradlew build. This is required because the jdk agent environment still does not support the latest java version. E.g. the `sonar scanner` is not compatible with the latest java version.
