= Terraform Jenkins agents

== Introduction
This agents are used to deploy (Cloud) resources using terraform code.

There are two terraform jenkins agents available:
1. jenkins-agent-terraform (ruby 2.7.5, terraform 1.2.x) - this agent is *DEPRECATED* and will be removed in the next release.
1. jenkins-agent-terraform-2306 (ruby 3.2.2, terraform 1.4.6, and matching tools) - this is the current active jenkins agent.

The images are built in the global `ods` project and are named `jenkins-agent-terraform` and `jenkins-agent-terraform-2306`.
