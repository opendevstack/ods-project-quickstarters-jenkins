= Scala Jenkins agent

== Introduction
This agent is used to build Scala code through SBT (Scala build tool).

The image is built in the global `ods` project and is named `jenkins-agent-scala`.
It can be referenced in a `Jenkinsfile` with `ods/jenkins-agent-scala`.

== Features
. SBT 1.1.6
. HTTP proxy aware
. Nexus aware

== Known limitations
In case HTTP Proxy config is injected through environment variables (including `NO_PROXY`), Nexus configuration is disabled because of an SBT bug.
