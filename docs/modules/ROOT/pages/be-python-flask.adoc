= Backend Python Flask Quickstarter (be-python-flask)

The project supports generation of Python Flask project boilerplate and quick
installation and integration of it with OpenShift CD pipelines.

== Purpose of this quickstarter

The quickstarter is simmple WEB-server written on Python using Flask framework.
The package allows easily build a Python project, using different Python modules
and frameworks.
It contains the basic setup for Docker, Jenkins, SonarQube and OpenShift.

== Frameworks used

* https://gunicorn.org/[gunicorn]
* http://flask.pocoo.org/[flask]
* https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/[pytest]
* https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[mypy]
* https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/stable/[flake8]

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

The project is production ready when deployed in OpenShift thanks to gunicorn.

It is recommended when you are developing a Python project to use separated environments.
For this purpose usually one can use
https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[virtualenv] package.

[source,bash]
----
# Command install virtualenv package (run only once)
pip install virtualenv

# Creates virtual environment 'mylocaldevelopment' (will be located in the folder mylocaldevelopment) (run only once)
virtualenv mylocaldevelopment

# Initiate virtual environment for the project (every time)
source mylocaldevelopment/bin/activate

# Runs installation of required modules in the virtual environment (run only once)
pip install -r src/requirements.txt

# Start your application
python src/main.py

== How this quickstarter is built through Jenkins

The Jenkinsfile is provisioned with this quick starter to ease CI/CD process. In Jenkinsfile, there are various stages:

* *Prepare Test Suite* - Prepares the virtual environment for testing and linting:
+
[source,bash]
----
  pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
----

* *Lint* - Runs mypy and flake8 for increasing code quality:
+
[source,bash]
----
  mypy src
  flake8 --max-line-length=120 src
----

* *Test* - Runs pytest and generates xUnit and code coverage reports:
+
[source,bash]
----
  cd src/
  python -m pytest --junitxml=tests.xml --cov-report term-missing --cov-report xml --cov=. ../tests/
----

* *Build* - Builds the application: copies src folder into docker/dist folder.

== Builder Slave used

This quickstarter uses https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/tree/master/common/jenkins-slaves/python[Python] builder slave Jenkins builder slave.

== Known limitations
