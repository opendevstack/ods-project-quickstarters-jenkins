== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

The quickstarter sets up two pods in OpenShift. The `ds-jupyter-notebook` instance is routed through the https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy/[OpenShift OAuth proxy] instance.

The directory `/opt/app-root/src/work` is created where code can be organized using installed git. +
Please consider mounting a persistent volume claim for this path. +
New python requirements are specified using the `requirements.txt`

== How this quickstarter is built through jenkins

The build pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` in the project root. The main stages of the pipeline are:

. Start OpenShift build
. Deploy image to OpenShift

== Builder slave used

https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/tree/master/jenkins/slave-base[jenkins-slave-base]

== Known limitions

Consider if sufficient computing resources can be provided by the OpenShift cluster.
