== Frameworks used

This project is generated by https://cli.angular.io/[Angular CLI]

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

* Run command `npm install` in project directory to install npm packages.
* Run `ng serve --open` command for dev server.

== How this quickstarter is built through Jenkins

The build pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` in the project root. The main stages of the pipeline are:

* stageBuild - Builds the application by running `npm install`, `npm run build` command and copies output folder `dist` into `docker/dist` folder.
* stageUnitTest - Runs unit test cases by executing command `npm run test`. This will also create test coverage analysis data which will then be transfered to SonarQube during odsComponentStageScanWithSonar
* stageLint - Runs `ng lint` profiler by running command `npm run lint`.
* odsComponentStageScanWithSonar - Triggers a code quality analysis by transfering code and test coverage analysis data to SonarQube. By default files like `*.spec.ts`, `*.modules.ts` and `src/environments/**` are excluded from the analysis, since they usually don't contain logic. Please revisit `sonar-project.properties` to configure analysis inclusions and exclusions according to your project's needs.

Please note: By default the applciation is always build as full production build including all sorts of optimizations. In addition source maps will be added except for builds that are triggered from `master`. This can be changed by configuring (additional) build configurations within `angular.json` and by using them via stageBuild or `package.json`.
